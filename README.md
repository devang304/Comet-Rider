OVERVIEW:
This is a native Android application to provide UT Dallas students with a detailed schedule of the campus shuttle.

Features include:
1) Reminders
2) Route Map
3) Street View of bus stops

PURPOSE:
I developed this application while learning Android Development using Java. My idea was to learn Android dev while working on an
application that I could use on a daily basis.
